# Greenhouse_proj<br />
Codes done to interface RaspberryPI with various sensors for the Automated coldframe research project. Some are in Python, some are in C.

<br />
Guidelines to all collaborators:<br />
1) Coding styles should follow closely to existing codes.<br />
2) Communication is key when merging. Notify collaborators before doing a merge when a merge conflict arise!<br />
3) There should be function declarations (for good reasons) either in the header for each associated c code or right after<br />       the #includes if in the c-code itselfs. <br />
<br />
4) Always ASK if unsure of anything, be it a git command or the structure of a code block. <br />
